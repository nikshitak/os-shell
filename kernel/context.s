    // What follows is very delicate code. Let's remember where things are:
    //     - %eax points to the save area for the source thread
    //     - %ecx points to the save area for the target thread
    //     - %edx points to the function we need to call after we achieve the switch
    //     - %esp points to the source stack but everything has been shifted by 4 beacuse
    //       we pushed the flags above
    //     - the argument we need to pass to this function is still sitting on the source
    //       stack
    //     - both save areas have the no_preempt flag set
    //
    // Here is what we want to achieve:
    //     - restore the target context (this includes the interrupt state)
    //     - clear the no_preempt flags but only when we are in a safe state
    //     - switch stacks
    //     - call the switch handler on the new stack allowing it to manipuate the
    //       source TCB and stack in any way it sees fit (delete, schedule, ...)
    //
    // We will be walking on egg shells for a few instructions

    cli    # disable interrupts until we get our target context established
           # why?
           #    - we might be switching back into apitHander and need to be conservative
           #    - give us a chane to quickly do any cleanup work we need to do
